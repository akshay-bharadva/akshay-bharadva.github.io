            Heya! I&apos;m fullstack developer and life-long learner,from India, living in
            ON, Canada. I enjoy learning new technologies and collaborating with
            other developers to make products a reality. I also enjoy
            open-source, and despite having a full-time job, I devote time to
            exploring open-source projects and studying their tech stack and
            coding conventions.

            Fun but sad fact: I often misspelled the return keyword. i.e,{" "}
            <span className="text-primary-400">&ldquo;reutrn&rdquo;</span>. let me
            know if you have any trick so that I can avoid this mistake.(P.S. thanks to linter for preventing me to broke pipeline of the deployment ðŸ˜…)
